# Architecture Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the Flash Loans Arbitrage Bot architecture, explaining the system components, their interactions, and the design principles behind the implementation.

## System Architecture

The Flash Loans Arbitrage Bot is built on a microservices architecture that separates concerns into distinct, loosely coupled services. This design enables scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

### Core Components

![Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture_diagram.png)

1. **Core Module**
   - Central controller for the arbitrage bot functionality
   - Manages the lifecycle of arbitrage operations
   - Coordinates between different services

2. **Flash Loans Service**
   - Interfaces with various flash loan providers (Aave, dYdX, Uniswap V3, Balancer)
   - Handles flash loan execution and repayment
   - Manages provider-specific implementations

3. **Arbitrage Service**
   - Identifies profitable arbitrage opportunities
   - Calculates optimal trading routes and expected profits
   - Simulates transactions before execution

4. **Mempool Service**
   - Monitors blockchain mempool for pending transactions
   - Identifies potential arbitrage opportunities from pending transactions
   - Detects sandwich attack opportunities

5. **Portfolio Service**
   - Manages wallet connections and balances
   - Tracks transaction history and performance
   - Handles portfolio rebalancing

6. **User Interface**
   - React-based frontend with Next.js
   - Real-time data visualization
   - User-friendly controls for bot configuration

### Data Flow

1. **Opportunity Discovery Flow**
   - Price data is collected from multiple DEXs
   - Arbitrage service analyzes price differences
   - Profitable opportunities are identified and ranked
   - Opportunities are presented to the user or auto-executed

2. **Execution Flow**
   - User or auto-execution system triggers a trade
   - System determines whether to use wallet funds or flash loans
   - Transaction is prepared and simulated
   - Transaction is submitted to the blockchain
   - Results are recorded and portfolio is updated

## Technology Stack

- **Redis**: Caching and real-time data
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction

### Frontend
- **React**: UI library
- **Next.js**: React framework
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **PM2**: Process management
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy
- **JWT**: Authentication

## Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern
Used for creating provider-specific implementations of flash loan and DEX adapters.

```typescript
// Example of Factory Pattern in Flash Loan Service
class FlashLoanFactory {
  static createProvider(type: string): FlashLoanProvider {
    switch (type) {
      case 'aave':
        return new AaveProvider();
      case 'dydx':
        return new DydxProvider();
      // Other providers
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${type}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Strategy Pattern
Used for implementing different arbitrage strategies.

```typescript
// Example of Strategy Pattern in Arbitrage Service
interface ArbitrageStrategy {
  findOpportunities(tokens: Token[]): Promise<Opportunity[]>;
}

class SimpleArbitrageStrategy implements ArbitrageStrategy {
  async findOpportunities(tokens: Token[]): Promise<Opportunity[]> {
    // Implementation for simple arbitrage
  }
}

class TriangularArbitrageStrategy implements ArbitrageStrategy {
  async findOpportunities(tokens: Token[]): Promise<Opportunity[]> {
    // Implementation for triangular arbitrage
  }
}
```

### Observer Pattern
Used for real-time updates and event handling.

```typescript
// Example of Observer Pattern for event handling
class EventEmitter {
  private listeners: Map<string, Function[]> = new Map();

  on(event: string, callback: Function): void {
    if (!this.listeners.has(event)) {
      this.listeners.set(event, []);
    }
    this.listeners.get(event)!.push(callback);
  }

  emit(event: string, data: any): void {
    if (this.listeners.has(event)) {
      this.listeners.get(event)!.forEach(callback => callback(data));
    }
  }
}
```

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Services can be deployed across multiple instances
   - Redis is used for distributed locking and coordination
   - Stateless design enables easy scaling

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient algorithms for opportunity detection
   - Caching of frequently accessed data
   - Batch processing for high-volume operations

3. **Resilience**
   - Circuit breakers for external service calls
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Graceful degradation when components fail

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Two-factor authentication

2. **Data Protection**
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - Private keys never stored in plaintext
   - HTTPS for all communications

3. **Transaction Security**
   - Simulation before execution
   - Gas price management
   - Transaction monitoring

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **New Providers**
   - Additional flash loan providers can be added by implementing the provider interface
   - New DEXs can be integrated by creating adapter implementations

2. **Enhanced Strategies**
   - The strategy pattern allows for new arbitrage strategies to be added
   - AI/ML models can be integrated for predictive analysis

3. **Additional Features**
   - The microservices architecture allows for new services to be added
   - The event-driven design enables easy integration of new components
